# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to deepen my understanding of data science capabilities and learn how to use programming languages (such as R), which could potentially widen my skillset for future career paths
- I am interested in learning about data technologies and their applications to real-world problems

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
