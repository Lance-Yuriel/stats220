## About Me
- I am taking a degree in **Computer Science**.
- I am currently taking **STATS 220** because I want to *deepen my understanding* of data science capabilities and learn how to use programming languages (such as R), which could potentially widen my skillset for future career paths.
- I am interested in learning about data technologies and their applications to real-world problems.

## My Goals in STATS 220
1. To get good at R programming and be able to apply it to future projects.
2. To learn how to tidy, organise, and present data clearly.
3. To build projects that solve real-world problems using what I've learned.
